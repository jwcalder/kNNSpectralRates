# kNNSpectralRates
The code in this repository reproduces the experimental results on convergence rates for k-nearest neighbor graph Laplacians from our paper 

Calder and Garcia Trillos. [Improved spectral convergence rates for graph Laplacians on epsilon-graphs and k-NN graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13476). arXiv:1910.13476, 2020.
